/**
 * PiqueData serves as the primary class for interacting with this library. It provides methods to work
 * with common data needs in Pique wrappers. These methods are designed to work with multiple database contexts.
 * Currently, these contexts are "local" or "persistent". The local context builds a containerized instance
 * of MongoDB Community Edition and mirrors the NVD there. The persistent context allows members of the SECL
 * to interact with our on-prem mirror of the NVD.
 *
 * If this class does not provide you with the calls you want to make, please speak with Ryan Cummings in the Software
 * Engineering and Cybersecurity Lab. This utility should include most common use cases for data access in the lab. New
 * functionality will be added as needed.
